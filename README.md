# SPD_Front_End
SPD uses the Ionic framework to provide its users with parking deck statistics, eliminating time wasted searching for a parking space. The application uses the Ionic framework and Firebase's Real Time Database. Chosen for its cross platform capabilities, Ionic provides a simplistic interface for users to check and see how many available parking spaces there are in each parking deck. The Firebase Real Time DB immediately pushes any changes made to the database, allowing users to have the most accurate information available. 

**Future Changes:**
- Add statistics. For example, busiest days/hours for each parking deck.
- Examine reservation capability. (Being able to reserve a parking spot in advance). 

**Software Used**
- Ionic framework (Angular.js)
- Firebase Real Time Database

**Tests**
- To test fullscreen in browser: ionic serve
- To test Android/iOS versions: ionic serve -l
 
###**ABOUT SPD (Smart Parking Deck):**
 The SPD platform was created as a senior capstone project at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Charlotte by Giang Dao, Itgel Ganbold, John Earl, Matthew DeBerry, and Taylor Smith. Frustrated by the amount of time wasted making loops around parking decks while searching for an available space, the idea for our project was born. The SPD platform aims to eliminate this problem by using live image tracking software to provide its users with real time statistics. For example, how many available parking spaces there are in a specific parking deck.
